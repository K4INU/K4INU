##### *Finders_Keepers.ps1*

```Simple script to look for ipv4 ip addresses in csvs that are not parsed out. I make this to pull out ip addresses from paloalto fw logs as the activity is usually not parsed in a clean method. this data can then be deduplicated and ran against IPGraveDigger to run against abuseipdb for reputation```


##### *IPGraveDigger.ps1*

```script to bulk run abuseipdb info data to hunt for evil.```


##### Raven.ps1

```This is a script I developed to help hunt against m365 purview's audit data. It has specific methods to hunt for irregular activity and looks for paterns related to EvilGinx attacks. This script has parts of IPGraveDigger in it and also includes ip info.```
